<!-- 
	We put the <script> tag at the bottom for two reasons:
    1. when the browser hits a <script> tag it will delay rendering the page so, for usability, if we put our <script>s at the end the page will render faster
    2. If the Javascript is executed in the <head> the <body> won't be rendered yet so we won't be able to manipulate our HTML.
